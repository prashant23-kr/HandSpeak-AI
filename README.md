# 🤟 HandSpeak-AI

HandSpeak-AI is an **AI-powered hand gesture and sign language recognition system** that uses **computer vision and deep learning** to interpret hand gestures and convert them into meaningful outputs.  
The goal of this project is to **bridge communication gaps** between hearing-impaired individuals and others.
